Hello! I am a Ph.D. student at the [Auton Lab](https://autonlab.org/) in the School of Computer Science at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), advised by Prof. [Artur Dubrawski](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/artur-w-dubrawski/). Prior to pursuing my Ph.D., I obtained a B.S. in Computer Science (Information Security) from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China and a Master of Information Systems Management (MISM) from Carnegie Mellon University.

My research focuses on LLM-based agents, particularly for machine learning (ML) engineering tasks. Recently, I have been working on: 
<ul>
  <li>Benchmarking LLM agents on ML engineering tasks (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13291">TimeSeriesGym</a>) </li>
  <li>Developing agents that automate end-to-end ML engineering workflows </li>
  <li>Improving LLMs for agentic use through multi-tasking and personalization (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05133">P-RLHF</a>) </li>
</ul>
Feel free to reach out to me if you are interested in my research and would like to collaborate!
