Hello! I am a Ph.D. student at the [Auton Lab](https://autonlab.org/) in the School of Computer Science at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), advised by Prof. [Artur Dubrawski](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/artur-w-dubrawski/). Prior to pursuing my Ph.D., I obtained a B.S. in Computer Science (Information Security) from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China and a Master of Information Systems Management (MISM) from Carnegie Mellon University.
