  title={Personalized language modeling from personalized human feedback},
  author={Li, Xinyu and Lipton, Zachary C and Leqi, Liu},
  abstract={Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is commonly used to fine-tune large language models to better align with human preferences. However, the underlying premise of algorithms developed under this framework can be problematic when user preferences encoded in human feedback are diverse. In this work, we aim to address this problem by developing methods for building personalized language models. We first formally introduce the task of learning from personalized human feedback and explain why vanilla RLHF can be ineffective in this context. We then propose a general Personalized-RLHF (P-RLHF) framework, including a user model that maps user information to user representations and can flexibly encode our assumptions on user preferences. We develop new learning objectives to perform personalized Direct Preference Optimization that jointly learns a user model and a personalized language model. We demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method through (1) a synthetic task where we fine-tune a GPT-J 6B model to align with users with conflicting preferences on generation length; and (2) an instruction following task where we fine-tune a Tulu-7B model to generate responses for users with diverse preferences on the style of responses. In both cases, our learned models can generate personalized responses that are better aligned with the preferences of individual users.},

  title={Automated Assessment of Cardiovascular Sufficiency Using Non-Invasive Physiological Data},
  author={Li, Xinyu and Pinsky, Michael R and Dubrawski, Artur},
  abstract={For fluid resuscitation of critically ill individuals to be effective, it must be well calibrated in terms of timing and dosages of treatments. In current practice, the cardiovascular sufficiency of patients during fluid resuscitation is determined using primarily invasively measured vital signs, including Arterial Pressure and Mixed Venous Oxygen Saturation (SvO2), which may not be available in outside-of-hospital settings, particularly in the field when treating subjects injured in traffic accidents or wounded in combat where only non-invasive monitoring is available to drive care. In this paper, we propose (1) a Machine Learning (ML) approach to estimate the sufficiency utilizing features extracted from non-invasive vital signs and (2) a novel framework to address the detrimental impact of inter-patient diversity on the ability of ML models to generalize well to unseen subjects. Through comprehensive evaluation on the physiological data collected in laboratory animal experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed approaches can achieve competitive performance on new patients using only non-invasive measurements. These characteristics enable effective monitoring of fluid resuscitation in real-world acute settings with limited monitoring resources and can help facilitate broader adoption of ML in this important subfield of healthcare.},

  title={Deep survival machines: Fully parametric survival regression and representation learning for censored data with competing risks},
  author={Nagpal, Chirag and Li, Xinyu and Dubrawski, Artur},
  abstract={We describe a new approach to estimating relative risks in time-to-event prediction problems with censored data in a fully parametric manner. Our approach does not require making strong assumptions of constant proportional hazards of the underlying survival distribution, as required by the Cox-proportional hazard model. By jointly learning deep nonlinear representations of the input covariates, we demonstrate the benefits of our approach when used to estimate survival risks through extensive experimentation on multiple real world datasets with different levels of censoring. We further demonstrate advantages of our model in the competing risks scenario. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work involving fully parametric estimation of survival times with competing risks in the presence of censoring.},
